# FPrin Temperature Sensor Module Development
Temperature measurement devices are ubiquitous in engineering and other scientific fields because temperature is a parameter that affects nearly all systems and is often essential to measure and control. Through recent work at FPrin involving temperature measurement and analysis we surveyed a series of temperature sensors and found that many common sensors have a surprisingly large rated accuracy specification. For example, perhaps the most used type of temperature measurement device, the thermocouple, typically has a range of ±1-2 °C. For some applications this is an acceptable level of accuracy, but often is insufficient. FPrin aims to provide a cost-effective, easy to build and program, and most importantly highly accurate temperature sensor module that allows the user to measure ambient temperature with a high degree of confidence.
