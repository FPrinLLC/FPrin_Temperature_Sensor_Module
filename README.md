# FPrin Temperature Sensor Module Development
Temperature measurement devices are ubiquitous in engineering and other scientific fields because temperature is a parameter that affects nearly all systems and is often essential to measure and control. Through recent work at FPrin involving temperature measurement and analysis we surveyed a series of temperature sensors and found that many common sensors have a surprisingly large rated accuracy specification. For example, perhaps the most used type of temperature measurement device, the thermocouple, typically has a range of ±1-2 °C. For some applications this is an acceptable level of accuracy, but often is insufficient. FPrin aims to provide a cost-effective, easy to build and program, and most importantly highly accurate temperature sensor module that allows the user to measure ambient temperature with a high degree of confidence.

The temperature sensor module has two different style of plastic housing, snap fit (left) and screw boss (right). The snap fit housing uses a plastic flexure to secure the upper and lower housing together and can be removed without any tools. The screw boss housing is assembled using 4 x thread-forming screws that securely fasten the upper and lower housing together.

### Where to get started:
To get started with the temperature sensor module, check out the User Manual and Bill of Materials! The User manual contains a step-by-step guide for building and programming a temperature sensor module in less than 1 hour. The Bill of Materials will tell you everything you need to build a temperature sensor module as well as links to where we bought our materials.
